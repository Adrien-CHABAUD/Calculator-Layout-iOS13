## Goal Behind

The aim here was to put into practice what have been learnt so far about auto layout, stack views and setting constraints.

## General Info

This app is calculator. This project had different challenges: Bronze, Silver and Gold. The basic thing was to create the vertical and horizontal stacks required for the layout. Then after details representing the three different challenges can be done.

* Bronze Medal: If you can figure out how to have the layout be constrained to the Safe Areas in Portrait and Landscape. (Notice the distance to the edges is different between landscape and portrait.

* Silver Medal: If you can figure out how to indent the Label with the 0 so that there is 20px distance from the right edge of the screen.

* Gold Medal: If you can figure out how to make the 0 button take up twice as much width as the "." and "=" buttons.

* How to add constraints and understanding how Auto Layout works.
* How to Pin and Align elements.
* How to create containers to configure advanced layouts.
* How to debug auto layout errors.
* Understanding what Xcode needs in order to correctly layout a design.
* How to use Stack Views to create complex interfaces.
